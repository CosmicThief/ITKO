            <p><strong>Yoshi</strong> has a variety of abilities that make him stand out amongst other characters in the <strong>Mario series</strong>. He has a prehensile tongue that can extend a surprising distance, allowing him to eat almost anything; anything that can't be eaten can be spit out at enemies. In some games the tongue can also be used as a grappling hook to pull objects or access otherwise out-of-reach areas. <strong>Yoshi</strong> is also capable of laying distinctive spotted eggs after swallowing objects, which can then be thrown at enemies or objects; eggs are in fact the primary "logo" of <strong>Yoshi</strong> in multiplayer games. <strong>Yoshi</strong> is also capable of forming an egg around himself and rolling around. By rapidly flapping his arms and legs, <strong>Yoshi</strong> can hover in midair or even gain height (depending on the game), this "flutter jump" makes difficult jumps much easier to accomplish. <strong>Yoshi</strong> is also a heavy user of the ground pound, dropping from the air onto targets. <strong>Yoshi's</strong> large nose allows him to detect hidden collectibles by smell, and aside from kicks and tail whips, is <strong>Yoshi's</strong> main instrument of close-range combat.</p>
            <p><strong>Yoshis</strong> come in a variety of colours, including green, red, blue, yellow, cyan, pink, purple, black, white, orange, and brown. In some games the colour of a Yoshi provides additional abilities: in <strong>Super Mario World</strong>, red Yoshis can breathe fire, blue Yoshis have wings, and yellow Yoshis produce damaging dust clouds on landing. In other games, eating fruit changes a <strong>Yoshi's</strong> colour and provides an ability; <strong>Yoshis</strong> in <strong>Super Mario Sunshine</strong> can spit fruit juice to defeat enemies and create platforms, while those in <strong>Super Mario Galaxy 2</strong> can use fruit to gain super speed, inflate like a balloon, or produce a platform-enabling glow. <strong>Yoshis</strong> of various colours appear often in multiplayer games as alternate choices, which may or may not have tweaked stats.</p>
